MERN-Instant-Coffee-App

#### This application was developed for the purpose of practicing the MERN stack
####### ... and also a tribute (?) to all the coffee I drank while developing this.

### Remaining TODOs
======
1. Client Side
+ Image upload handling
+ Change price to accept floats instead of integers
+ Sorting by lowest to highest price
+ OAuth ?

2. Server Side
+ Verify if item already exists in database (handle accordingly)
+ Seal off all unauthorized requests
